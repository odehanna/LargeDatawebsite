# Tropical Bird Species

Tropical birds are remarkably diverse and beautiful not only to look at but also to listen when they sing.  All the bright colours and the sizes of the birds are very inspiring; as well as the fact that some of them are able to learn to speak.

Tropical birds are some of the most beautiful animals in the world, and some of them make wonderful family pets.

## Purpose

This project is a school project to learn about making design systems for large-scale websites.

Iâ€™m excited to learn about using Git and GitHub in a classroom setting.
