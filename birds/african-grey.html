          <h1>African Grey</h1>
          <p>The African Grey is a species of parrot bird known to rainforests of  West Africa and Central Africa. Intelligent, strong, and visually striking, the African Grey parrot is rare. Readily identifiable, the Grey has an intense personality and profile as opposed to a mere "pet".

          <h2>Information</h2>
          <p>The African Grey is a species of parrot bird known to rainforests of  West Africa and Central Africa. Intelligent, strong, and visually striking, the African Grey parrot is rare. Readily identifiable, the Grey has an intense personality and profile as opposed to a mere "pet". Two major species of the Africa Greys exist, with two additional types of African Grey nearing subspecies ranking, including the Ghana and Cameroon African Greys. </p>


<p>The Congo African Grey (Psittacus erithacus erithacus) has a cherry red tail and a black beak, while the Timneh African Grey (Psittacus erithacus timneh) has a dark-maroon tail. The Congo African Grey parrot makes an excellent pet, but many types of the African Grey species are on protected and threatened bird species lists, so they aren't legally available as pets. These birds will want an educated owner with possibly no small children and no other pets.</p>
 
 
<p>The African Grey is known for its intelligence, rarity, inclusion of Linneausâ€™ familiar work on the source of natural species, and its gradations of charocoal and light grey in the feathered layers of wing, shoulder, and tail. Claims that these Grey parrots have evolved from singularly tree dwelling lifestyles meet with various levels of enthusiasm from the academic and veterinary community.</p>
 
<p>Clipping of the African Grey is not advised. Avian caged and domesticated African Greys will have many more issues with training, interaction, children friendliness, and boredom than moderately demanding bird pets. Caging challenges, access/cost, and dietary needs make Grey parrots highly training-intensive pets. African Greys are very strong physicaly, and they are also strong-minded, making them not generally recommended for casual domestic households.</p>
 
<p>The African Grey parrot typically has a lifespan of 60 years in captivity, and possibly longer for those in the wild.  The African Grey subsists on a diet rich in calcium and Vitamin A. Many types of African Grey parrots are considered endangered natural wildlife and occur in nature with diminishing frequency. Deforestation of native lands aids to the rarity of these parrots, as does the increasingly dangerous pet trade export traffic for African Greys. Working with a reputable breeder is strongly recommended when purchasing any tropical bird, but it is especially recommended in the case of African Grey parrots.</p>
 
<p>The African Grey can be found wandering the tree twigs and branch brush of countries like Tanzania, Sierra Leone, Kenya, the Congo, and Angola. Like the macaw or cockatoo parrots the African Grey can make conversation and be wordy with owners and trainers. The putative subspecies of the African Grey family, the Cameroonian and Ghanese Greys, will also share the fate of the African Grey as illegal export traffic builds and native forests decline.</p>
 
<p>One organization that is helping with African Grey conservation efforts is the Limbe Wildlife Centre. In December of 2007, the organization rescued 1,220 African Grey parrots, and they released about 700 of the birds within just a few weeks. The remainder of these birds were injured, and the organization helped them recover with the help of the World Parrot Trust. Instead of releasing these birds in another forest, they are simply opening the cage to allow the birds to leave at their leisure.</p>
