          <h2>Guatemala</h2>
          <p>Guatemala is home to an impressive number of species of birds that vary from residents, that stay all year around, to breeding birds, that spend a good part of the growing season in Guatemala to raise their young, migrants who pass through Guatemala with the seasons, to wintering birds who like to spend a good part of the winter in Guatemala to escape colder conditions up north. While many species of birds are relatively common as they are part of the ecosystems of the state, it is always a thrill to stumble upon a rare bird or vagrant, that does not really form part of any the Guatemala ecosystems. Maybe it got lost during its travels between its summer and winter residence or it got displaced by bad weather.</p>

<p>Among the species of the checklist of the birds of Guatemala you can find  waterfowl and wading birds, a large suite of song birds, raptors, game birds, swifts and nighthawks, etc., many of which occupy several ecosystems simultaneously, as they fly to and from forests, meadows, shorelines of waters, cities and and urban green spaces. At Birdlist, we have developed a coding system that can help you predict when you may expect a certain species, with a code for seasonality, such as resident, nesting, wintering, etc. A code for abundance will give you a clue on the likelihood that you may actually see a certain species of bird. As we progressed with the coding, we realized that there should be a differentiation in the coding for "common", such as less common, common and very common birds. However, this would require reliable quantative data, which for most states, are not revealed by the commission of bird records. We hope to provide those in the future.</p>

          <h2>Panama</h2>
          <p>The Republic of Panama, a tropical country with a large variety of easily accessible habitats, is a great place not only for an introduction to the birds of the American tropics, but is also one of the best birding place in the world. </p>
<p>The typical neotropical families, like trogons, antbirds, and tanagers are well represented, some, like the tyrant flycatchers, by a hundred different species, and others by just a few. The avid birder will find the total number of bird species found in Panama, about 950, delightfully large, especially when considering the relatively small surface of the country. Some 150 of these are neotropical migrants that only occur in the country from September until April. It is not rare to see more than twenty different migrant warblers and vireos on a good morning on spring or fall migration, and that added to fifty or sixty resident species.
This variety in bird species is partly explained by the fact that Panama is a land bridge between North and South America. Therefore, Panama's resident avifauna is composed of a mix of birds from both North and South America. </p>
<p>In Panama it is possible to find species typical of Central America like Passerini's Tanager, Green Shrike-Vireo, and Resplendent Quetzals, as well as their South American Counterparts: Flame-rumped Tanager, Yellow-browed Shrike-Vireo, and Golden-headed Quetzal. </p>
<p>As it would be expected, the South American birds are easier to find on the eastern portion of the country, while the Central American species are found west of the Canal Area. The birds of the central part of the country, the area surrounding Panama City, include species from both ends. </p>
<p>Eastern Panama, San Blas and Darién, are generally inaccessible, and visiting requires extensive planning. However, it is well worth the hassle, especially if you really need a Speckled Antshrike on your life list. In Eastern Panama you'll also have a better chance of seeing the Harpy Eagle, Panama's National Bird. There is a road out in that direction, but the best way to get there is by plane. There is regular service to a few small towns in the lowlands, like El Real, but to get to Cana and the foothills you'll have to either charter a flight or hike all the way up. The foothills is where the endemics are: Green-naped Tanager, Pirre Warbler, Beautiful Treerunner, Tacarcuna Wood-Quail, etc. A lot of the Darién specialties can also be found in the lowlands. A few species can only be seen in the lowlands, like Black Oropendola, Spectacled Parrotlet and Black Antshrike. </p>

          <h2>Puerto Rico</h2>
          <p>Birds of Puerto Rico coded for abundance, breeding, migration, wintering, endemic, rare, etc.; 2000 pages on birds, nature, birdwatching, where to go birding, birds and nature pictures, nature conservation, equipment, bird feeding, etc. Welcome to the bird list of Puerto Rico.</p>
