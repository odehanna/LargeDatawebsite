          <h1>Endangered Species</h1>
          <p>Costa Rica boasts an estimated 850 bird species of which 630 are resident species and 19 are endangered. Rare birds like the Quetzal and Scarlet Macaws can still be seen in the various protected reserves of Costa Rica. Many travel to Costa Rica to catch a glimpse of the fascinating Quetzal. This endangered species can be seen throughout the highland area and at cloud forest elevations. The Great Curassow is another endangered bird species found in the Santa Rosa or the Corcovado National Park.</p>

<p>Costa Rica is also home to an estimated 50 raptor bird species. These birds of prey include the common Black Hawk, Osprey and the extremely rare Harpy Eagle which can mostly be found in the remote Talamanca ranges and in the Osa Peninsula region. There are approximately 17 owl species, around 51 species of the humming birds, 100 species of sea and shorebirds including a variety of gulls and some 25 species of endemic neo-tropical and migratory birds in Costa Rica. Also the country provides habitat to 16 species of parrots including 6 species of parakeets and 2 species of macaws.</p>

		<h2>Costa Rica</h2>
          <p>Costa Rica holds nearly 5% of the world biodiversity and lies in the bird-rich neo-tropical region. This astounding biological diversity has given the country a wide array of habitats. Home to one-tenth of the world’s total bird species, the country provides critical habitat to several extinct birds which have all but disappeared from other areas of the world due to deforestation.</p>

          <p>Classified as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the total wild population of the blue-throated macaw is believed to only be 250. This stunning species, which usually lives in bonded pairs, has two main threats: destruction of the bird’s ecosystem from cattle ranching in the bird’s Bolivian ecosystem and the illegal worldwide pet trade.

          <p>Thought to be all but extinct in 1999 due to its popularity in the exotic pet trade industry, this aerial beauty is one of Latin America’s most successful conservation efforts. Today more than 1,000 specimens live in wax palm trees in the cloud forests of the Colombian Andes.</p>

		 <img class="bird-img" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/kagu.jpg" alt="photo of ">
          <p>A rare New Zealand bird, not much is known about the enigmatic Kagu. It is flightless, though its wings are large; it is a forest-dweller, though its markings are oddly light in color. Very few remain and scientists know little about its preferences and habits. We do know that it possesses “nasal corns” unlike any other bird. For reasons unknown, the kagu also has one-third the red blood count of other birds. Scientists have had a difficult time classifying this rare and unusual bird.
